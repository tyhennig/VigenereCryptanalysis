# VigenereCryptanalysis
A basic cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher using Index of Coincidence and Chi-Squared.

As of 3/4/2021 it doesn't produce key candidates, it just assumes the lowest IC and ChiSquare produce the key.
  This can result in small ciphertexts not producing the right key. Something to add in the future.
